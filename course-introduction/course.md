# CSE 310 - Course Report

Name: Dylan Butterfield

## Part 1 - Semester Planning

This section should be filled out during Week 1 and submitted.

### Section 1.1 - Module Planning

During this course you get to decide what technologies and languages you want to learn.  After looking at the Module Description document in Canvas, select 5 modules that interest you.  You will be responsible for learning the material and creating software to demonstrate what you learned.  The software that you write will be placed in your personal software portfolio. You can change you mind later in the course based on your experiences.  Try to select modules that stretch your current abilities.  

You will work on one module in every 2 week Sprint.  During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Mark only one "X" in each of the five columns.  The "Choose Your Own Adventure" can only be selected starting in Sprint 3.

### Section 1.2 - Goal Setting

Every Sprint you will be setting a goal to improve one of your learning skills.  Learning technology is fun.  However, we don't want to neglect learning how to learn better.  Your ability to use new technology and handle difficult situations will improve as you give attention to your learning skills.

1. Complete the following Learning Skill Survey:

|Learning Skill Survey (3=Frequently, 2=Sometimes, 1=Rarely |           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
|**Time Management Skills**                                 |**Ranking**|
|I use multiple sources of information.                     |     2     |
|I document what I am learning.                             |     1     |
|I prepare well-thought-out questions.                      |     2     |
|I experiement and make observations.                       |     2     |
|I share what I am learning with others.                    |     2     |

|**Risk Management Skills**                                 |**Ranking**|
|I always start with identifying what I do not know.        |     2     |
|I identify what could fail based on previous experiences.  |     3     |
|I create mitigation plans for risks.                       |     1     |
|**Continuous Improvement Skills**                          |**Ranking**|

|I develop improvement plans for future work.               |     2     |
|I am motivated by goals and vision (growth mindset).       |     3     |

2. Based on your resonses in the survey above, pick one area that you want to improve.  Write a "Small and Simple" goal to improve in this area throughout the semester.  Write your goal below:
    The area I picked: Risk Management Skills.
    The goal: Start each week by identifying one potential challenge or obstacle I may encounter, and create a simple plan to mitigate it.


## Part 2 - Semester Conclusion

This section should be filled out during Week 14 and submitted.

        After a long semester of learning new things, its good to pause and consider what you experienced.  You learned many new technologies and languages on your own. You have the capability to continue to do this outside of school. Sprint 6 and beyond is in your hands.

1. As you have worked individually and as a team to develop your personal software portfolio, how have your technical skills improved?

        As an individual, I've been able become more comfortable trying new things which has added to my technical skills (React, .NET, etc.). As a team, my technical skill for Unity has grown and udnerstanding the fundamental aspects of game creation and project managment could help me in the future.

2. Identify at least one technology or language you learned this semester that you want to continue to improve after this course.  What is your next step?

         Two technologies I learned this semester that I want to continue to improve are Firebase and Networking. For Firebase, my next step is to delve deeper into its advanced features such as Cloud Functions, Firestore Security Rules, and real-time database synchronization to build more complex and secure applications. I'll follow tutorials, read documentation, and implement small projects to solidify my understanding. For Networking, I plan to enhance my knowledge of protocols, socket programming, and network security. I will do further research on those things.

3. Look back at the goal you wrote at the beginning of the semester (Part 1 above).  What was the result of your goal?  Did your goal change during the semester?  What do you want to work on next to improve your ability to learn?

        The result of my goal was successful. Each week, I made it a point to point out what challenges I can encounter and help mitigate them. My goal did not change this semester because I felt like I needed to always improve my identification and mitigation of obstacles instead of giving up like I used to. For my next goal, I want to focus on enhancing my project management skills, particularly in coordinating team efforts and meeting deadlines, as these are critical for my future career as a Software Project Manager.
