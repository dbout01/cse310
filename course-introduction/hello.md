# CSE 310 - Hello World Module Report

Name: Dylan Butterfield

## Part 1 - Module Planning

On the first Monday of each Sprint, you will complete the planning section of the Module Report.  Topics include module selection and planning.  For the Hello World program, you will not fill in this section.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. For the Hello World program, you will record your time from Week 1 here.

### Section 2.1 Time Log

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module (Hello World this week) or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

6. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

    - Some strategies that worked well during this Sprint were reviewing notes (behavioral)
    and applying ideas from W3Schools (technical) to brush-up on my C# skills.
    - I honestly can't think of anything that didn't work well. This week's assingment was simple, but the next Sprint will be more comprehensive.
    - Some possible ways I can improve next Sprint are: practice more coding & discussing my endeavors with classmates more often to get more ideas/feedback.
