## Overview

**Project Title**: Hello World

**Project Description**: A program that uses user input to display an output text of "Hello World."

**Project Goals**: Brush-up on my C# skills & get myself into the coding/practicing mindset again.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:
1. Install Visual Studio: If the user doesn't have Visual Studio installed, they can download and install it from the official Microsoft website.
2. Open Visual Studio: Launch Visual Studio after installation.
3. Create a New Project: Go to "File" > "New" > "Project" in the menu. Select "Console App (.NET Core)" under the "C#" section. Give your project a name and choose a location to save it. Click "Create."
4. Write the Code: In the newly created project, you'll see a file named Program.cs open in the editor. This is where you write your C# code.


Instructions for using the software:
1. Open the Program: Locate the program file or application icon on your computer. Double-click on it to open the program.
2. Wait for Execution: After opening the program, wait for it to run. Typically, this happens instantly for such a simple program.
3. View Output: Once the program runs, you should see a window or terminal open, displaying the text "Hello World". This is the output of the program.
4. Close the Program (if necessary): If the program does not close automatically, you can close the window or terminal where the output is displayed.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VSCode (v1.88.1)
* .NET Install Tool extension for VSCode (v2.0.3) (complements the SDK)
* .NET SDK Tool for Windows (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* C# extension for VSCode (v2.23.15)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php)
* (Notes from Programming with Classes, still a source of usefulness)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] More creativity; allowing more things to be displayed
* [ ] Add two or three inputs to create more interactivity
