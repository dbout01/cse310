# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Dylan Butterfield

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?: 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |       X       |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
    - You must create a database for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.
    - Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.- This module requires more than just creating the database and determining SQL commands. You must write software that builds the SQL commands, submits them, receives the results from the database, and uses the results in some way.



### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    - https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/default.asp
    - https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
    - Notes from last Spring Semester
    - SQlite Tutorial
    - Python sqlite3 official site review
    - TutorialsPoint: SQlite - Python review
    - https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-aggregate-functions/

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    - Review notes from last spring
    - Review W3Schools articles about MySQL
    - Review W3Schools articles about SQL (different from SQL)
    - Compare MySQL & SQL fundamentals
    - Review Guidance section websites

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    - SQlite
    - Files from VSCode

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    - Monday 4/29 & 5/6, ~17:30-19:00 both days
    - Tuesday 4/30 & 5/7, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Wednesday 5/1 & 5/8, ~07:00-09:00 both days
    - Thursday 5/2 & 5/9, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Friday 5/3 & 5/10, ~07:00-09:00 both days

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    - Technical Risk: Having forgotten specific aspects of the program (ie the relationship of two tables)
    - Behavioral Risk: Forgetting to work on a specific day


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/l9S33DVcGMk

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
Stretch challenge: Use at least two of the aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in your database.
        - SQLite COUNT() function to add add all country populations
        - SQLite AVG() function to calculate the average GDP of the entire world

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
        - No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|       16:01       |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

        Strategies that worked:
        - Setting apart specific times during the day- was mostly followed

        What didn't work well:
        - Reviewing notes from my CIT 111 class- turns out I didn't need Workbench and was useless for 1/3 of the project

        Ways to improve next sprint:
        - Ask for more teacher feedback during the process
        - Put-in more hours at the beginning of the Sprint to armed with more info on how to complete it.
