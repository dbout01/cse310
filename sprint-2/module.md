# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Dylan Butterfield

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 2

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |       X       |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
            "Write multiple functions (not necessarily part of a single piece of software) in TypeScript that demonstrates some of the following:
                Display output to the terminal.
                Recursion
                Classes
                Lists
                Asynchronous functions"

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project
    - https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/
    - https://www.typescripttutorial.net/
    - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html
    - https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started
    - https://youtube.com
    - https://chat.openai.com/

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    - Review websites listed
    - Watch YouTube videos on basic set-up, how-to, etc.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    - Monday 4/29 & 5/6, ~17:30-19:00 both days
    - Tuesday 4/30 & 5/7, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Wednesday 5/1 & 5/8, ~07:00-09:00 both days
    - Thursday 5/2 & 5/9, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Friday 5/3 & 5/10, ~07:00-09:00 both days


5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    - Technical Risk:  Running into errors during the project, more specifically connecting code together
    - Behavioral Risk: Forgetting to work on a specific day, not putting forth enough effort


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/dbout01/discography-explorer/tree/main

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/4U6MaJPM-c0

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |  Yes   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  Yes   | (Didn't get terminal to work but TypeScript was used in conjunction with JavaScript and ESlint & Nodejs is availible for future backend development)
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |  Yes   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |  Yes   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |  Yes   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
        - Use TS Lint

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
    - No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      10:39        |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
    What worked well
        Behavioral
        - Time management
        Technical
        - learning how the different components are used before building

    What didn't work well
        Behavioral
        - Taking a step back and examining how much I was trying to do all at once
        Technical
        - Learning how to correctly implement Node.js into my project

    Way to improve next sprint
        - Focus on one thing at a time when building the project instead
        of trying to do a million things at once
