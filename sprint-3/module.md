## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
        Develop software that interacts with a cloud database. The software must have the following characteristics:
            - You must create a database using a cloud service for your program to use including at least one table to store data into.
            - Your software must demonstrate the ability to insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data.


### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
        - CSE 310 Module summary sources:
            - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore
            - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore


2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
        1. Scan all study resources in the CSE 310 module summary sources
        2. Look at the two websites listed and study the contents

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
        - Python
        - Firestore
        - Service Account JSON File
        - GitHub

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
        - Monday 4/29 & 5/6, ~17:30-19:00 both days
        - Tuesday 4/30 & 5/7, ~12:00-14:00 both days
        - Wednesday 5/1 & 5/8, ~07:00-09:00 both days
        - Thursday 5/2 & 5/9, ~12:00-14:00 both days
        - Friday 5/3 & 5/10, ~07:00-09:00 both days

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
        - Technical: having trouble connecting Firestore to database via Firebase Console
            Mitigation plan: taking my time making sure I'm following each installation step carefully
        - Behavioral: Not feeling like implementing all goals I made for myself
            Mitigation plan: Take one goal at a time, not overthinking different aspects of the app


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
   What worked well
        Behavioral
        - Time management
        Technical
        - learning how the different components are used before building

    What didn't work well
        Behavioral
        - Taking a step back and examining how much I was trying to do all at once

        - Learning how to correctly implement the API into my project

    Way to improve next sprint
        - Focus on one thing at a time when building the project
