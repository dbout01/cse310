List the unique module requirements below:
        - Most important: Home, About, Portfolio, Skills, & Contact elements
        - Create a carousel for projects completed, each with a clickable logo that takes the user to
            a github project
                - Basic project desriptions
        - Create a circle graph that represents all hard skills
        - Create a circle graph that represents all soft skills
        - Create a call to action for potential employers/clients
        - User Friendly
        - Dark & Lightmode
        - Compatibility for 6.7" screens on web browsers

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
        - https://www.chartjs.org/
        - https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
        - https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/build-a-portfolio-website/

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
        1. Read through Chartjs & Slick documentation
        2. Make files separate from the project as a whole and run tests to see what works/doesn't
            before implementing the elements

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
        - HTML
        - CSS
        - JavaScript

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
        - Monday 4/29 & 5/6, ~17:30-19:00 both days
        - Tuesday 4/30 & 5/7, ~12:00-14:00 both days

        - Technical:
            Mitigation plan:
        - Behavioral: Deciding to skimp on features and/or pleasing ui elements
            Mitigation plan: Make a thorough list of each feature I want


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.
