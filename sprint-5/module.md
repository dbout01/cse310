Name: Dylan Butterfield

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 5

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|

|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |       X       |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |

|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:
    Write a program that allows one computer to communicate with another computer using the following:
    - Client-Server Modelâ€”You will need to write one program for the client and one program for the server.
    - The client must send a request to the server. A response must be sent back and used (e.g. displayed)
    - You can use either TCP or UDP.
    - Provide support for at least three different kinds of requests that the server or the peer can respond to.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model
    - https://www.howtogeek.com/190014/htg-explains-what-is-the-difference-between-tcp-and-udp/

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
    1. Read through all documentation from #1
    2. View YouTube tutorials for examples
    3. Begin basic structure of project (files & accompanying code)

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    1. Python Files
    2. Socket
    3. OS Module
    4. Pip

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    - Monday 4/29 & 5/6, ~17:30-19:00 both days
    - Tuesday 4/30 & 5/7, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Wednesday 5/1 & 5/8, ~07:00-09:00 both days
    - Thursday 5/2 & 5/9, ~12:00-14:00 both days
    - Friday 5/3 & 5/10, ~07:00-09:00 both days
    - Locations: Apartment & Apartment Clubhouse

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    Technical Risk
    - Running into server connection errors
        Mitigation Plan
        - thorough testing and reviewing of server connection & setups
    Behavioral Risk
    - Getting lazy
        Mitigation Plan
        - Making sure I'm held accountable


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

        What worked well
        Behavioral
        - Motivation/excited to make the application work properly
